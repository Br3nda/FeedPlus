This is a very simple Python script that pulls the public feed for any
given Google+ ID, and saves an Atom 1.0 xml file, "atom.xml" in that
directory.

This was done primarily to replace Russell Beattie's PlusFeed application
which I'd been using to republish my G+ feed to Twitter, via TwitterFeed,
until the GAE pricing changes made that unviable.

Given my focus on Twitter here, the Atom I'm producing truncates summaries
to 140 chars.

Parsing the G+ feed was done with help from the following:

Usage: feedplus.py <G+ id> <dir>
